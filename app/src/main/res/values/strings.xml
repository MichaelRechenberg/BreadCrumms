        <h1>Bread Crumms Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>The Bread Crumms Android Application will hereafter be referred to as \"THE APPLICATION\".</p>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>THE APPLICATION was a pet project of mine (Michael Rechenberg) developed in the Summer of 2016.</p>
        <p>If you want to contact me please email mrechenberg09@gmail.com</p>

        <h2>Data The App Collects And Stores</h2>

        <p>The latitude, longitude, and time of which the latitude and longitude was stored will
        hereafter be referred to as \"LOCATION DATA\".</p>
        <p>The Android device that THE APPLICATION runs on will hereafter be referred to as \"DEVICE\".</p>

        <h3>Why THE APPLICATION Collects And Stores LOCATION DATA</h3>
        <p>THE APPLICATION is centered around location: THE APPLICATION uses LOCATION DATA
        in order to generate a heat map based off of where you were most often in the past.
        In order to generate a heat map based off of where you were most often in the past, THE APPLICATION needs to
        store your location periodically. </p>

        <h3>How and When THE APPLICATION Collects And Stores LOCATION DATA</h3>
        <p>When you turn on the Tracking Service
        (done by clicking \"Turn On Tracking\" within THE APPLICATION), THE APPLICATION will periodically request the
        location of your DEVICE and store the latitude and longitude of that location as LOCATION DATA.
        <b>Note that the Tracking Service occurs in the background and continues even if you continue to have THE APPLICATION open,
        switch to other applications on your DEVICE, or lock your DEVICE\'s screen.</b>
        You can turn off the Tracking Service at any time via THE APPLICATION.
        You can select how often THE APPLICATION
        will request for your DEVICE\'S location and store new LOCATION DATA within THE APPLICATION\'s settings.
        Turning off the Tracking Service will remove the periodic request for your DEVICE\'s location and
        stop the storage of any new LOCATION DATA until the Tracking Service is turned on again.
        </p>
        <p>THE APPLICATION will not collect or store any LOCATION DATA if the Location setting of your
        DEVICE is turned off.  If THE APPLICATION requires your Location setting of your DEVICE to be on,
        you will be explicitly requested to turn it on.</p>
        <p>When initially opening up the Heat Map Activity THE APPLICATION may use your recent location
        to set the camera of the Google Map.</p>

        <h3>Where LOCATION DATA Is Stored</h3>
        <p>Your LOCATION DATA is stored on your DEVICE only.</p>

        <h3>How Long LOCATION DATA Is Stored</h3>
        <p>Your LOCATION DATA is stored on your DEVICE as long as you have THE APPLICATION installed on your DEVICE.</p>


        <h3>Deleting Your Stored LOCATION DATA</h3>
        <p>You can delete all your stored LOCATION DATA at any time via THE APPLICATION\'s settings.
        Also, if you uninstall THE APPLICATION
        from your DEVICE then your stored LOCATION DATA will also be deleted.</p>

        <h3>Disclosure Of LOCATION DATA to Third Parties</h3>
        <p>Your stored LOCATION DATA is not shared with any third parties.</p>


        <h2>Third Party Information</h2>
        <p>THE APPLICATION uses the Google Maps API for Android in order to show satellite imagery
        of locations.  Google Maps may use cookies in its implementation.  Links to Google\'s Privacy Policies and Terms of
        Service are http://www.google.com/policies/privacy
        and https://www.google.com/intl/ALL/help/terms_maps.html.  Usage of THE APPLICATION binds
        you to Google\'s Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>Children\'s Privacy</h2>
        <p>THE APPLICATION is intended for a general audience and does not knowingly collect, solicit, or store personal information from children under 13.</p>


        <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is subject to change without notice.</p>

        <h2>Your Consent And Privacy Policy Efficacy</h2>
        <p>By using THE APPLICATION you consent to this privacy policy and  the
        privacy policy is effective upon your consent.</p>

        <h1>About Section</h1>
        <h2>What Bread Crumms Does</h2>
        <p>Bread Crumms is an app that allows you to track and store your location and then
        visualize where you were most of the time using a heat map.  You can choose to view
        your location data from the past month, week, day, or whatever range of dates you prefer.
        Then you can select the area you want to analyze using a Google Map, scrolling to whatever location you
        want or jumping to a specific latitude and longitude, and generate your heat map.
        You can adjust the opacity of the heat map and what type of Google Map you want to use
        (Satellite, Terrain, or Normal).  Once you\'ve generated your perfect heat map, you can click the save icon
        and save a snapshot of your heat map for posterity.</p>

        <h2>What Does Bread Crumms Do With My Device\'s Current And Past Location Data?</h2>
        <p>Look at the Privacy Policy for the full details, but the short version is that
        your location data is stored on your phone only and not shared with third parties.</p>

        <p>Your location data is erased when you uninstall the app or select \"Clear Data\" for the app
        within Android\'s app settings.</p>

        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>This app was a pet project of mine (Michael Rechenberg) developed in the Summer of 2016.</p>
